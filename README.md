Cocktail Keeper
===============

This web application is used to store and manage cocktail recipes. For each recipe you specify the ingredients to use, quantities, and the directions for creation it. You can also set the background color and pick a built-in drink vessel that should be used (rocks, coupe, highball, etc). You can also order the main list as you see fit.

It is designed to run on a mobile device and stores all its data in browser storage. It can export your recipes in a JSON file or restore from a prior
backup. My desire was to have a no-fills app that simply stores recipes I input, not provide or suggest them, and allows me to back them up somewhere.

It is based on [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and was inspired by the [Highball app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id973319934) from
[Studio Neat](https://www.studioneat.com/).
