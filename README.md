Cocktail Keeper
===============

This web application is used to store and manage cocktail recipes. For each recipe you specify the ingredients to use, quantities, and the directions
for creating it. You can set the background color and pick a drink vessel that should be used (rocks, coupe, highball, etc). You can
also order the main list as you see fit, and make a copy of a recipe if a new one is very similar.

It is designed to run on a mobile device and stores all its data in browser storage. You can export your recipes in a JSON file or restore from a prior
backup. My desire was to have a no-frills app that stores recipes I input, not provide or suggest them, and allows me to back them up somewhere.

It is based on [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and was inspired by the [Highball app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id973319934) from
[Studio Neat](https://www.studioneat.com/).
