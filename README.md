Cocktail Keeper

This web application stores cocktail recipes. For each recipe you add you specify the ingredients, quantities, and directions for creation it. You
can also set the background image and pick a built-in image that indicates the vessel that should be used (rocks, coupe, highball, etc). You can also
order the main list as you see fit.

It is designed to run on a mobile device and stores all its data in browser storage. It can export your recipes in a JSON file or restore from a prior
backup. My desire was to have a no-fills app that simply stores recipes I input, not provide them, and allows me to back them up somewhere.

It is based on [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and was inspired by the [Highball app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id973319934) from
[Studio Neat](https://www.studioneat.com/) as inspiration.
